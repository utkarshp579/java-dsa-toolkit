Day 1: Project Setup & Foundational Data Structures
Task 1 (1 hour): Project Setup

Create a new GitHub repository named java-dsa-toolkit.

Initialize a new Java project in your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code).

Create the package structure: com.dsa.toolkit.datastructures, com.dsa.toolkit.algorithms, and com.dsa.toolkit.main.

Write the initial README.md file with a title and a brief project description. Commit and push your changes.

Task 2 (2-3 hours): Linked List & Stack

Linked List:

Create the Node class.

Create the SinglyLinkedList class with a head field.

Implement addAtHead(), addAtTail(), delete(), and printList() methods.

Test your implementation by creating a list in the main method and calling these functions.

Stack:

Create the Stack class.

Use an ArrayList as the underlying data structure for a quick implementation.

Implement push(), pop(), and peek(). Add a check for an empty stack.

Test your stack implementation in the main method.




Day 2: More Data Structures & Introduction to Algorithms
Task 1 (2 hours): Queue & Graph

Queue:

Create the Queue class.

Use a LinkedList as the underlying data structure for an efficient implementation.

Implement enqueue() and dequeue().

Test your queue implementation.

Graph (Adjacency List):

Create the Graph class.

Use a HashMap<Integer, List<Integer>> to represent the adjacency list.

Implement a method addEdge(int u, int v, boolean isDirected) to add edges.

Implement a printGraph() method to visualize the structure.



Task 2 (1-2 hours): Sorting Algorithms

Binary Search:

Create a Search class in the algorithms package.

Implement binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) for a sorted array.

Merge Sort:

Create a MergeSort class.

Implement the sort() method and the merge() helper function. Focus on getting the recursive logic right.

Test it with a sample array in your main method.

Day 3: Advanced Algorithm & Cleanup
Task 1 (3-4 hours): Dijkstra's Algorithm

This is the most complex task, so dedicate the entire day to it.

Create a Dijkstra class in your algorithms package.

Your dijkstra(Graph graph, int startNode) method will need a PriorityQueue to store nodes to visit.

You will also need a HashMap or an array to store distances.

Focus on the logic:

Initialize distances.

Push the start node to the priority queue.

Loop while the priority queue is not empty.

Extract the minimum distance node.

Update distances of its neighbors.

Test it with a small, simple graph to verify the output.

Day 4: Refinement & User Interface
Task 1 (1-2 hours): Code Refinement & Comments

Go through all your code. Ensure variable names are clear.

Add Javadoc comments to each class and method. This is a crucial step for a professional project. Explain what each method does, its parameters, and its return value.

Task 2 (2-3 hours): Main Class & Menu System

Go to your com.dsa.toolkit.main.Main class.

Build a user-friendly console menu using a Scanner for input and a switch statement.

The menu should allow the user to:

Run the linked list demonstration.

Run the sorting algorithm demonstration (e.g., Quick Sort vs. Merge Sort).

Run the Dijkstra's pathfinding demonstration.

This will provide the "modular architecture reducing setup time" feature you mentioned in your resume.

Day 5: Final Touches & Documentation
Task 1 (1-2 hours): Final Testing & Bug Fixes

Run through your menu system again.

Check for edge cases (e.g., empty lists, single-element arrays).

Fix any bugs or logical errors.

Task 2 (2-3 hours): Finalizing README & GitHub

Update your README.md with the final features.

Add a "How to Use" section with clear instructions on how to run the project.

Add a "Contributing" section (even if it's just for show, it's good practice).

Take some good-looking screenshots of your terminal output to include in the README.

Commit and push your final changes to GitHub.

Check your GitHub profile to ensure the project looks polished and professional.
